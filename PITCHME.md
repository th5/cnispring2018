Digital Preservation & Conservation

Largely non-technical

Still, many tech and tech-related decisions

Fuzzy boundaries

Many decisions impact much more than preservation

Situation:
Many "repos". Each may serve particular purpose. 
Purpose may be related to repos features. However likely also strong
historic reasons.

Get a lay of the land:

* Which systems do you have now?
* What is in each?

+++

Get a lay of the land:

* How do users *feel* about the systems?
* Repos are easy to start, hard to kill.
* Likely too many, with several disliked.

Know your user:

* What do they say they want?
* What do they actually want?
* *Listen!*

+++

Know your user:
<br>
Which do they like? Why?
<br>
What do they need?
* Viewers
* Particular metadata support
* Workflow
* Permissions

+++

Know your user:

* Are there any installations that they like?
* Don't limit this question to only your institution.

+++

Know your user:

* What are they saying they need?
* Buzzwords?
  * Linked data / RDF / triplestore

+++

Know your user:

* Are there other systems they want to integrate with?
* What protocols do they speak? OAI-PMH?

+++

Know your user: Hosted vs local?

* Perception vs reality
* Hosted solutions often solve the easy problems. Leaving your team to work on priorities
* On the other hand, hosted often solves the easy problems

Know your user:

* What system/s do they say they want?
* Reasons?
* Which features?

Know your enemy:

* What other systems are being considered?
* Where are the major features of other systems?

Know your enemy:

The project formerly know as Hydra-Fedora

* Administrators hear how powerful it is, assume can solve all their problems.
* No magic bullets!
* No shortcuts around *the work*
* Great project btw, Fedora is really solid

p.s. linked data is slow...

+++

Know your enemy:
Hydra-in-a-box (Hyku)

* Vaporware
* Spent whole time on naming??
* I know I'm in minority with this. Huge respect for their team.

Know your enemy:

What features are your users talking about, hearing from sales reps, colleagues, etc?

DSpace has many features that others tout as new or advanced. Sometimes
different terminology is used.

+++

Know your enemy:

e.g. a commercial hosted offering is selling itself as able to
"use any metadata standard". Compared to DSpaces built-in Dublin Core
this sounds more advanced. However what they actually meant is that you
could write a cross-walk from any standard to their internal metadata model.
DSpace already has that!

Hearts and minds

Librarian vs IT
Often saying same thing, just speak different languages. Cloud can be seen as
way to get around IT ("those people think preservation is making a backup!?").

Build bridge people! So desperately needed

Learn DSpaces capabilities

Learn benefits
* Not just a pile of code. Duraspace is crucial supporting infrastructure.
* Robust commercial development community
* Excellent practical documentation
* Attentive to needs of small institutions!

---

What would be best for us?
* Ideal repo for my institutions doesn't exist
* DSpace + theme + media players (+ a little custom dev ?)
* Instead of paying for expensive product/hosting, consider paying dev time

---

Know DSpaces downsides
* Permissions, e.g. search snippets don't respect perms
* "Add-ons" require development (not one-click to add player, etc)
* Time it takes to admin installation, whether local or hosted
* Default theme visually uninspiring
* No buzz. This isn't a joke. Prominent vaporware has a lot more hype
surrounding it.
